Where is this data from?
--------------------------------------
The data comes from the College Scorecard, a data set of statistics compiled of accredited universities around the United States. This data is collected by the U.S. Department of Education and is available to everyone online. Around 2,850 schools are a part of our visualizations just waiting to be discovered by future students. 
	
Where do I start?
--------------------------------------
1. If you have already taken the standardized tests find other schools that fit your test scores, population size, and the type of degree you want. 
2. If exploring all the options sounds more appealing, you can view the map feature. It will allow genuine exploration geographically and it will provide more insights into any school that sparks an interest. Click on the markers to learn more about the specific school, you can even visit the website with links to every university.
3. The third feature allows you to look at the raw data that provides even more insights than we could provide to you. This is for someone who knows what schools they want to attend and want to know specifics about it and see how it compares to other schools based on a wide range of categories.
